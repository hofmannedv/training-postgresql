= Preface =

An example database for the first steps using PostgreSQL.

The file `publications.data` consists of the example database
`publications` with two tables named `authors`, and `publications`. This
example shows how to select data, and specify the data output.

== Selecting data ==

To display the contents of the authors table use the `SELECT` command as
shown below. The * operator selects all the columns from the named
table.

----
publications=# SELECT * FROM authors; 
 id |    name
----+-------------
  1 | Ken Follet
  2 | Ian Rankin
  3 | Stephen Fry

To display the contents of the publications table and sort by
publications title in descending order, the `ORDER BY` statement comes
into play. The statement `DESC` sorts in descending order, and `ASC` in
ascending order, respectively. `ASC` is the default sort order.

----
publications=# SELECT * FROM publications ORDER BY booktitle DESC;
 id | authorid |     booktitle     
----+----------+-------------------
  1 |        1 | World Without End
  2 |        2 | Set In Darkness
  4 |        1 | Jackdaws
  3 |        2 | Black And Blue
